# NeuroVox

NeuroVox is an Obsidian plugin that enhances your note-taking with voice transcription and AI capabilities. Record your voice, transcribe it, and apply custom AI prompts to the transcription.

## Features

- **Voice Recording**: A mic icon will appear in your note, which you can press to record.
- **Transcription**: Automatically transcribes your voice recordings using the [OpenAI Whisper API](https://openai.com/index/whisper/) along with Groq.
- **Custom Prompts**: Apply custom prompts to the transcription to summarize, extract to-dos, or other actions.
- **Audio Playback**: Embeds the audio file in your note for easy access.
- **Embedded Output**: Transcriptions and AI-generated outputs are embedded in your notes as callouts wherever your cursor is.
